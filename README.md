# Dungeon Master's Campaign Manager

A Gatsby theme for DMs to manage interactive map notes, list NPC information, store rule references, and keep track of monster/spell stats. It's a big binder of notes, just for you.

## Description

- Hover over battle maps for a quick look at what your players will experience in each room or click to see your in-depth notes. No more scrambling to remember what happens in Room 2 of the Lich's Dread Dungeon.
- Each campign has a table to list your NPCs, so recalling what accent or job Glenda from Riverport had isn't cause for panic.
- Can't remember what the rules for a drowning character are? Want to know how to describe damage during combat? Can't remember how much horse shoes cost? It's all covered in your rules Reference.
- Store all your monster stats and spell information in the Spellbook/Bestiary.
- Clickable dice rolls for attacks/saves/checks.
- All done in markdown (`.mdx` files) with minimal coding necessary.
